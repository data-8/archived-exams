\q{10}{Steph Curry Fan Club}

A group of current Data 8 students who are big fans of Steph Curry are inspired by the current course material to conduct an analysis of Curry's basketball shot record. It turns out Steph Curry has a 58\% chance of successfully shooting the ball in the basket any time he tries.

\subq{2} Curry shoots the ball twice. What is the probability that both of the shots make it in the basket?\vskip 0.1in

\subq{2} Curry shoots the ball twice. What is the probability that one shot makes it into the basket, and one shot does not?\vskip 0.1in

Digging deeper into Steph Curry's basketball record, the students find that 80\% of Curryâ€™s shots are contested - that is, someone is actively trying to block his shot or make him miss. When a shot is contested, Curry has a 55\% chance of successfully shooting the ball in the basket any time he tries. When his shots are not contested, Curry has a 70\% chance of shooting the ball in the basket.
